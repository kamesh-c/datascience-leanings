    "### Components of Time Series\n",
    " - Trend - Event happens for a period of time ( variance mean over time)\n",
    " - Seasonality - Event happens for a particular season ( or fixed Period of time)\n",
    " - Irregularity - Unexpected Event occurred ( Also called as Noice/ Residual/ random variations)\n",
    " - cyclic -  Repetitive event for specific period of time ( Much harder to predict)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When not to user time series analysis?\n",
    " - Values are constant ( if the sales is beeing for fixed for past couple of months, predicting of next month sales is not a value add on applying time series model\n",
    " - Values is the form of functions (Sign wave/ => x = f(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is stationarity?\n",
    "Time series has a perticular behaviour over time, there is high probability that it will follow the same in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to remove Statinarity?\n",
    "    - Constant Mean ( Varing mean overtime aka Trend )  ( Mean is the average)\n",
    "    - Constant Variance (aka Seasonality) ( Variance is distence from the mean)\n",
    "    - Autocovariance that dose not depend on time "
